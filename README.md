# DS4400 Final Project
"Next came Dionysus, the son of the virgin, bringing the counterpart to bread: 
wine and the blessings of life's flowing juices. His blood, the blood of the grape, 
lightens the burden of our mortal misery."  â€” Euripides

We aim to use machine learning methods to determine if the color and quality of a wine can be 
predicted from its physical properties. We will use a dataset with eleven chemical features 
and around 6000 total observations, including classification as red or white and a rating of 
quality on a 10-point scale. We will utilize linear regression models and basis function expansion 
to predict the rating of each wine. We will also implement logistic regression and support vector 
machines to classify a wine by color.
